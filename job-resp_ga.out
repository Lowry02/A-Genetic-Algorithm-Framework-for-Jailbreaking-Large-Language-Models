Starting from v4.46, the `logits` model output will have the same type as the model (except at train time, where it will always be FP32)
From v4.47 onwards, when a model cache is to be returned, `generate` will return a `Cache` instance instead by default (as opposed to the legacy tuple of tuples format). If you want to keep returning the legacy format, please set `return_legacy_cache=True`.
